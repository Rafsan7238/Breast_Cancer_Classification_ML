# Breast Cancer Classification Using ML Models
This repository contains the source code for the classification of breast cancer using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree.

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset available from UCI Machine Learning. The dataset has first been preprocessed to remove redundancies and make it appropriate to run machine learning (ML) algorithms. The ML models used are `Decision Tree` and `Logistic Regression`. 

The final results show a `95%` and `94%` accuracy with Logistic Regression and Decision Tree respectively.
